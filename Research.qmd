The bulk of my research has taken place in aquatic ecosystems working with fish {{< fa ship >}}. However, I did spend several summers working with reptiles and amphibians in the beautiful hardwood forests and open oak savannas {{< fa tree >}} of Tennessee. Ultimately, I consider myself an ecosystem ecologist {{< fa earth >}} interested in untangling the threads linking pattern to process behind the "black box" of ecosystems, regardless of the system.
