    "text": "Salmon of the Southeastern U.S.: Sucker migrations deliver resource subsidies to oligotrophic stream\n\nThe ability for migratory fishes to move commonly limiting resources such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) between discrete environments can have pronounced effects on recipient ecosystems. To further understand the geographic and taxonomic scope of migratory fish resource subsidies, we quantified N and P subsidies delivered by ad-fluvial suckers (Smallmouth Buffalo, Ictiobus bubalus) via excretion, eggs and carcasses to a small oligotrophic stream during their annual spawning migration. We also com-pared nutrient inputs from migrant buffalo with watershed nutrient export to assess the likelihood that delivered nutrients were ecologically important. We estimated that approximately 67,000 buffalo delivered 730 kg of N and 80 kg of P to Citico Creek as a result of excretion and egg subsidies across three migration waves. We estimated that carcasses delivered negligible amounts of N and P due to extremely low retention. The ratio of migrant inputs (Mw) to system export (Ew; Mw/Ew) varied among three migration waves and compounds (i.e. dissolved inorganic nitrogen, ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus), with values for M w/Ew ranging from 0.25 to 5.10, reflecting the potential of nutrient subsidies to exceed nutrients exported from the system under certain conditions. Our findings suggest that suckers have the potential to deliver large resource subsidies to their spawning habitats and that these subsidies may be ecologically important, thus warranting additional consideration of the functional relevance of non-game fishes and their migrations.\n\n\n\nBuffalo nutrient subsidies during the 2020 Citico Creek spawning migration (mean and 95% confidence intervals)\n\n\n\n\nMigratory redhorse suckers provide subsidies of nitrogen but not phosphorus to a spawning stream\nSpawning migrations of fishes are common case studies for examining the magnitude of resource subsidies; however, no studies have evaluated this phenomenon in iteroparous migrations of the Catostomid (i.e. suckers) genus Moxostoma (i.e. redhorses). Fish resource subsidies are usually represented as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and migratory redhorses can deliver these nutrients via excretion and eggs. We evaluated whether redhorses deliver N and P subsidies to Brasstown Creek—a fourth-order stream in the Southeastern US during their spawning migrations. We measured individual-level nutrient contributions from excretion and eggs and extrapolated those values to estimate nutrient contributions based on daily abundances of migratory redhorses. We compared daily nutrient inputs to daily nutrient exports to determine the potential for resource subsidies. We estimated 71.6 kg of N and 4.4 kg of P were delivered to Brasstown Creek over a 98-day migration period. N input exceeded N export on 15 of the 98 days, but phosphorus input never exceeded P export. Eggs accounted for the majority of N and P input at 51% and 100% respectively. Redhorse N inputs peaked in the spring during a period of low N exports, suggesting that redhorse subsidies were delivered during times of elevated nutrient demand and relatively low nutrient availability. Suckers receive little management attention, and several species of redhorses are imperiled. Given our conclusion that redhorses provide a temporally critical N subsidy that is likely available to multiple consumers in freshwater food webs, this study provides compelling motivation for increased conservation of these species and their migrations."

    "text": "Research Statement\nI am an ecologist interested in the drivers of ecosystems across various scales (from individuals to ecosystems). My research currently revolves around further understanding the contextual roles of consumers in the cycling of nutrients and flow of energy within and across ecosystems. By combining field, experimental, and modeling techniques, I aim to bridge theories across different ecological disciplines to provide novel insights. The goal of my research is to provide a more holistic understanding of the natural world that informs conservation and management efforts. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate working with Dr. Jennifer Rehage in the Coastal Fish Ecology & Fisheries Research lab at Florida International University.\n\n\nScientific Background\n My interest in the natural world started early and at the end of a fishing line. Growing up in West Virginia, my mom felt it was important we spent time together enjoying our state’s natural wonders. Though she was not particularly “outdoorsy,” she made it a point to take at least a few camping trips to the mountains every summer. It was during these trips that I became enamored by the water. It seemed as if an entirely different world, one I could only temporarily observe, lay below the water’s surface. There was something exciting about the unhabitable. I quickly found fishing was a way to interact with this other world. Every time I caught a fish, I felt a little more connected to the water. The excitement only grew as I got older, and I found myself wanting to learn more about life below the water line.\n This led me to Marshall University to pursue my B.S. in Environment Science. It was during my undergrad that I was offered my first opportunity in “the field”. I spent the summer of 2017 doing stream restoration work as part of a collaborative effort between Trout Unlimited and the United States Forest Service in the Monongahela National Forest. I was able to see first hand how much damage had been done to native Brook Trout streams as a result of unregulated logging practices in the state, as well as how much hard work it took to try and restore them. It was a very fulfilling opportunity that propelled me into my final semester at Marshall, eager to see and learn more.\nSoon after graduating from Marshall in December 2017, I accepted a position as a contractual biologist for the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO). I spent the next eight months traveling throughout the Ohio River basin, surveying fish communities at locations contracted to ORSANCO under the US-EPA National River and Streams Assessment. This work provided me the opportunity to sample fish communities throughout the Ohio River basin in a variety of systems (headwater streams in southern New York to the main stem of the Ohio River in Illinois) using a number of different techniques. In addition to providing great field experience, this work incited further curiosity and a burning desire to ask my own research questions.\nI accepted an M.S. position with Dr. Kit Wheeler at Tennessee Tech University (TTU) to further my ability to develop hypothesis-driven questions and refine my research interests in January 2019. My thesis research quantified the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus delivered by sucker fish via excretion, eggs, and carcasses during their annual spawning migrations. My time at TTU was extremely rewarding. My advisor was hugely supportive and fostered an environment in which I was able to pursue my own research questions related to my thesis. I also discovered my love for teaching, as I taught biology and ecology courses for five semesters. Conveying my passion for science to excited students was very fulfilling and solidified my desire to pursue a career in academia with research and teaching duties.\nI accepted a Ph.D. position with Dr. Jennifer Rehage in the Coastal Fish Ecology & Fisheries lab at FIU to continue developing my abilities as a research scientist in August 2021. Across the last few years, I have spent the majority of my time working in Everglades National Park (ENP). I am currently leading two projects related to my dissertation research: (I) The South Florida Coastal Everglades Array (SRFCEA), which has been monitoring the movements of several ecologically and economically important fishes (i.e., Common Snook, Largemouth Bass, Bull Shark) using passive acoustic telemetry in the Shark River, ENP since 2011 and (II) the United States Army Corp of Engineer RECOVER Monitoring and Assessment Program (USACE RECOVER-MAP) which has been monitoring fish community composition at the marsh-mangrove interface in the Shark River, ENP since 2004. These projects, plus our food web monitoring program (2019-present) that I work closely with, are associated with the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Research (FCE-LTER) program. My dissertation research uses aspects of each of these projects to investigate the drivers of consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics (CND) across scales of ecological organization (individual-, population-, and community-) in the Shark River, ENP. focused I am fortunate to be the principal investigator of a synthesis working group funded by the US-LTER which aims to characterize spatiotemporal patterns in CND under the wake of global change across long-term research programs globally. Our working group is 20 members strong with representation across career stages and ecosystems (pelagic zooplankton communities in the Gulf of Alaska to coral reef fish communities in French Polynesia)."
